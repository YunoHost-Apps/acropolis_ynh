Acropolis is beta software, and under active development. Use at your own risk!

* This app require a dedicated domain or subdomain.
* No admin user is created during installation so you will need to sign up and follow manual steps to promote your user to admin.
* Configuration of the instance requires editing one or more config files which must also be done manually.
* Single sign-on doesn't work.

You may wish to close or limit registration for your instance of Ecko, so that the instance stays small. We invite you to block remote malicious instances from the administration interface.
